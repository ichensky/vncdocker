# vncdocker

Run gui applications, for ex. `firefox` as normal user with `docker` over `VNC with SSH`.

As display server used `xvfb`.

As vnc server used `x11vnc`.

VNC connection secured by ssh.

Sharing X display server with gui application over VNC with SSH should be more secure then sharing X display server from host OS with docker.
